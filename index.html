                    <p><font size="5"> The objective of the game is to extinguish a fire. You're the pilot of a Bombardier-415, better known as Canadair, flanked by your trusty co-pilot Camil who will give you many useful tips during the game.
                        First of all you have to choose the difficulty level among the 4 proposed:
                        <br><strong>Beginner:</strong> the wind is absent; you can fill the tank up to 40 meters from the sea; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X meters
                        <br><strong>Easy:</strong> the wind moves at 10 km/h; you can fill the tank up to 30 metres from the sea; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X metres.
                        <br><strong>Medium:</strong> the wind moves at 20 km/h; you can fill the tank up to 20 metres from the sea; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X metres.
                        <br><strong>Hard:</strong> two fires at the same time; the wind moves at 30 km/h; you can fill the tank up to 10 metres from the sea; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X metres.
                        <br><br>The fire spreads in every direction, with a higher speed in the wind direction. You will have to take off, fill the tank on the sea and empty it on the fire.
                        You will need to be as fast as possible to stop the uncontrolled expansion of the fire. Don't waste time, every second is precious.
                        <br><br>You can use the 'WASD' command set to control the aircraft's roll and pitch angles as if it were a cloche.
                        <br><strong>W</strong> to nosedive;
                        <br><strong>S</strong> to pull up;
                        <br><strong>A</strong> to tilt to the left;
                        <br><strong>D</strong> to tilt to the right;
                        <br>Remember that once you have put the cloche in position, it will remain fixed until it receives another command.
                        You can reset the roll angle by pressing the <strong>O</strong> key, while you can reset the pitch angle by pressing the <strong>P</strong> key.
                        In an emergency you can use the <strong>R</strong> key to completely reset the system, which will start flying at a stable altitude with zero roll and pitch angles.
                        <br><br>You can use the M button to turn the engines on and off (there is no reason why you should turn off the engines during flight),
                        and the <strong>B</strong> and <strong>N</strong> buttons to increase and decrease the speed, respectively.
                        There are 6 speeds available:
                        <br><strong>Speed 0:</strong> engines off;
                        <br><strong>Speed 1:</strong> approx. 150 km/h;
                        <br><strong>Speed 2:</strong> approx. 206 km/h;
                        <br><strong>Speed 3:</strong> approx. 263 km/h;
                        <br><strong>Speed 4:</strong> approx. 320 km/h;
                        <br><strong>Speed 5:</strong> approx. 376 km/h;
                        <br>Be careful never to go below 150 km/h or you will stall. In any case, your co-pilot Camil will warn you if you are flying too slow.
                        <br><br>You can use the <strong>C</strong> key to close the aircraft's landing gear.
                        Remember not to get close to the water with the airplane trolley open or you will risk crashing.
