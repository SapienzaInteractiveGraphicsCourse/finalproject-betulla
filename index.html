  		        <p><font size="5"> The objective of the game is to extinguish a fire. You're the pilot of a Bombardier-415, better known as Canadair, flanked by your trusty co-pilot Camil who will give you many useful tips during the game.
  		            First of all you have to choose the difficulty level among the 4 proposed:
  		            <br><strong>Beginner:</strong> the wind is absent; you can fill the tank up to 40 meters from the lake; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X meters
  		            <br><strong>Easy:</strong> the wind moves at 10 km/h; you can fill the tank up to 30 metres from the lake; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X metres.
  		            <br><strong>Medium:</strong> the wind moves at 20 km/h; you can fill the tank up to 20 metres from the lake; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X metres.
  		            <br><strong>Hard:</strong> two fires at the same time; the wind moves at 30 km/h; you can fill the tank up to 10 metres from the lake; the radius of the water you throw on the fire is X metres.
  		            <br><br>The fire spreads in every direction, with a higher speed in the wind direction. You will have to take off, fill the tank on the lake and empty it on the fire.
  		            You will need to be as fast as possible to stop the uncontrolled expansion of the fire. Don't waste time, every second is precious.
  		            <br><br>You can use the 'WASD' command set to control the aircraft's roll and pitch angles as if it were a cloche.
  		            <br><center>
  		            	<strong>W</strong> to nosedive;
  		            	<br><strong>S</strong> to pull up;
  		            	<br><strong>A</strong> to tilt to the left;
  		            	<br><strong>D</strong> to tilt to the right;
  		            </center>
  		            <br>Remember that once you have put the cloche in position, it will remain fixed until it receives another command.
  		            You can reset the roll angle by pressing the <strong>O</strong> key, while you can reset the pitch angle by pressing the <strong>P</strong> key.
  		            In an emergency you can use the <strong>R</strong> key to completely reset the system, which will start flying at a stable altitude with zero roll and pitch angles.
  		            <br><br>You can use the M button to turn the engines on and off (there is no reason why you should turn off the engines during flight),
  		            and the <strong>B</strong> and <strong>N</strong> buttons to increase and decrease the speed, respectively.
  		            There are 6 speeds available:
  		            <br><center>
  		            	<strong>Speed 0:</strong> engines off;
  		            	<br><strong>Speed 1:</strong> approx. 150 km/h;
  		            	<br><strong>Speed 2:</strong> approx. 206 km/h;
  		            	<br><strong>Speed 3:</strong> approx. 263 km/h;
  		            	<br><strong>Speed 4:</strong> approx. 320 km/h;
  		            	<br><strong>Speed 5:</strong> approx. 376 km/h;
  		            </center>
  		            <br>Be careful never to go below 150 km/h or you will stall. In any case, your co-pilot Camil will warn you if you are flying too slow.
  		            <br><br>You can use the <strong>C</strong> key to close the aircraft's landing gear.
					<br><br>Remember not to get close to the water with the airplane trolley open or you will risk crashing.
					When you arrive above lake level, be sure to descend to a suitable altitude to fill the tank.
					To open the tailgate and fill the water, press and hold the spacebar control. Remember to release it before you return to altitude or you will
					immediately lose the water you just loaded. Once the tank is full, head as fast as you can to the fire, choose the best spot to drain the water,
					and hold the space bar control to keep the tank doors open and drain the water. You can also decide not to drain the water all at once, but at different times,
					by releasing the space bar when the tank is not yet empty and pressing the button on the new location you have chosen.
					<br><br><strong>- Tip:</strong>Give priority to the extremities of the fire to prevent it from spreading, and especially to the part under the wind
					(e.g. if the wind blows from south to north, it is better to limit the fire in the north first).
					<br><br>This mission is not a tourist trip, remember not to leave the work area or take too much altitude,
					or the Commander will notice and you will pay the consequences ending the mission with a failure.
					The ideal working altitude is between 100 and 200 meters, if you exceed 600 meters your co-pilot Camil
					will warn you that you are flying too high and return to an acceptable altitude. If you exceed 800 meters,
					the situation will become unrecoverable and you will fail the mission.
					<br><br>I think we've told each other everything, good luck, you'll need it!
